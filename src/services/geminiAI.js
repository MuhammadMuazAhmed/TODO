        Each task should be:

        - Directly related to the goal
        - Realistic and practical

        - ENCOURAGING and positive
        - ACTIONABLE for self-reflection
        - CONTEXTUALLY relevant to their situation
        
        Focus on questions that help them:
        1. Celebrate specific achievements related to their goals
        2. Reflect on their current momentum toward their specific goals
        3. Plan their next steps for their actual goals
        4. Identify what's working well for their goal progress
        
        IMPORTANT: Make the questions specific to their actual goals. For example:
        - If they have a "Learn React" goal, ask about their learning progress
        - If they have a "Lose 10 pounds" goal, ask about their health journey
        - If they have a "Save $5000" goal, ask about their financial progress
        
        Format your response as a JSON array with objects containing:
        - question: The actual question text (be specific and contextual to their goals)
        - category: "celebration", "reflection", "planning", or "motivation"
        - context: Brief explanation of why this question is relevant to their goals
