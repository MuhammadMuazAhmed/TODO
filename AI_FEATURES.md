**Example messages:**

- "ðŸŽ‰ Fantastic work completing your daily workout! You're building a healthy routine that will pay off in the long run."
- "Excellent job finishing that project milestone! Your dedication to your long-term goals is truly inspiring."

## ðŸ’¡ New Task Analysis

When you add a new todo or goal, the AI analyzes it and provides:

- Acknowledgment of the task you added

**Example messages:**

- "Great addition! This learning task will help you grow professionally and stay competitive in your field."
